# Cervical Vertebrae Segmentation Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on segmenting cervical vertebrae from lateral cephalometric radiographs using deep learning models. The primary goal is to automate the segmentation of specific cervical vertebrae using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This segmentation task is critical for various medical applications, including diagnostics and orthodontic analysis.

**Note**: The dataset used for training and evaluation is not provided in this repository due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. The provided Jupyter notebook can be adapted for similar datasets.

## Key Features
- **Segmentation of Cervical Vertebrae**: Utilizes deep learning models to segment cervical vertebrae from lateral cephalometric radiographs.
- **Visual Comparison**: Compares predicted segmentation masks with true masks for visual analysis and model evaluation.
- **Applications in Medical Imaging**: Provides a framework to assist in automating the segmentation of cervical vertebrae in X-ray images.
